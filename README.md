# Leetcode Interview Preparation

This section contains all materials for preparing for coding interviews using Leetcode problems.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **easy/**: Easy difficulty problems (good for building fundamentals)
- **medium/**: Medium difficulty problems (most common in interviews)
- **hard/**: Hard difficulty problems (for advanced preparation)
- **topics/**: Problems organized by data structure/algorithm type
- **solutions/**: Your implemented solutions

## üéØ Study Plan

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (2
-3 weeks)
- Focus on **easy** problems
- Master basic data structures: arrays, strings, linked lists
- Learn basic algorithms: two pointers, sliding window

### Phase 2: Core Topics (4-6 weeks)
- Move to **medium** problems
- Cover all major topics systematically
- Practice 2-3 problems per topic daily

### Phase 3: Advanced & Mock Interviews (2-3 weeks)
- Tackle **hard** problems
- Time yourself (45 minutes per problem)
- Practice explaining your solution

## üí° Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Read carefully and identify edge cases
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Work through examples

2. **Plan Your Approach**
   - Think of brute force solution first
   - Optimize step by step
   - Consider time/space complexity

3. **Code Implementation**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Add comments for complex logic

4. **Test & Debug**
   - Test with provided examples
   - Consider edge cases
   - Trace through your code

## üìù Solution Template

```python
"""
Problem: [Problem Name]
Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
URL: [Leetcode URL]

Approach:
- [Brief description of your approach]
- Time Complexity: O(?)
- Space Complexity: O(?)
"""

def solution(input_params):
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test case 1
    assert solution(test_input) == expected_output
    print("All test cases passed!")
```

## üèÜ Practice Tips

1. **Consistency**: Solve 1-3 problems daily
2. **Time Management**: Set time limits (20-45 minutes)
3. **Review**: Revisit problems after a week
4. **Patterns**: Identify and learn common patterns
5. **Mock Interviews**: Practice with friends or online platforms
6. **Multiple Solutions**: Try to find different approaches
7. **Explain Out Loud**: Practice explaining your solution

## üìä Progress Tracking

Create a simple spreadsheet or use the checklist above to track:
- Problems solved per topic
- Difficulty distribution
- Time taken per problem
- Success rate on first attempt
